    "# Image Preprocessing Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Image preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing data for machine learning models, especially in computer vision tasks. This process involves several techniques to enhance the quality and consistency of the images. Below are the common image preprocessing methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resizing Images**: Adjusting the dimensions of images to a consistent size to ensure uniformity across the dataset.\n",
    "2. **Normalizing Pixel Values**: Scaling pixel values to a common range, typically between 0 and 1, to improve the performance of the model.\n",
    "3. **Data Augmentation**: Applying various transformations to the images to artificially increase the size of the dataset and improve the model's robustness. Common techniques include rotation, flipping, and cropping.\n",
