# About

Documentation for the Capstone project. This folder contains all the necessary information for the Capstone project which entails a structured set of assignments that will be completed over the course of the semester. The assignments are designed to help students develop a project from scratch, starting with the proposal and ending with a final project report and presentation.

Moreover, to ensure that I stay on track with the project, I have created a list of issues with associated milestones and labels. The issues are categorized into different milestones based on the assignment due dates. The labels are used to categorize the issues based on the type of work that needs to be done. That way, I can easily track the progress of the project and ensure that I am on track to complete the project on time.

I create this project with the intention of learning and developing a project from scratch. I hope to learn a lot from this project and develop a project that I can be proud of. I am excited to see how this project will turn out and I am looking forward to the final presentation.


For those that are interested in following along with the project, I will be updating this folder with all the necessary information for the Capstone project. I will also be updating the list of issues with associated milestones and labels through pull requests. So, feel free to check back often to see the progress of the project. I have created this a long time ago as you can see through the first few commits, but never got a good opportunity to work on it and develop my image/video recognition development skills. I am excited to see how this project will turn out and I am looking forward to the final presentation.
